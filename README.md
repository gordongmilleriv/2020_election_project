# 2020_election_project

## Brief Description 
Donald Trump won the 2016 Presidential Election and became the 45th President of the United States. He then lost his re-election campaign in the 2020 Presidential Election. There are multiple reasons that may have contributed to the termination of his Presidency such as changing voter demographic, poor candidate judgement, changing public opinion, etc (Bennett & Berensen, 2020). However, I wanted to analyze the following hypothesis: Donald Trump's constant diminishment of the COVID-19 virus' severity resulted in spikes in COVID-19 cases and negatively impacted approval ratings, causing a transition in voting outcomes in the 2020 Election.
